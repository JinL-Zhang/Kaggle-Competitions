## A1: Tabular Data. Multi-Class Classification. 
The dataset is the Airbnb listings of different areas in Montreal during 2019. It comes with rich information for each listing, including a link to the thumbnails etc. We build models to predict the listing price based on the listing characteristics. In this way, we can optimize the user experience and lower the bar to be a new host! Predicting the actual price could be simple (you can just find it online), so we cut the pricing into three different bins for classification. For each listing, we recommend a pricing range to the new host rather than a fixed price (how nice is that!). So we define three categories: beginner, plus, premium based on the created listing. Respectively we use 0, 1, 2 to denote these three categories.

## A4: Text/Sequential data. Sentiment analysis. 
A typical many-to-one sequence binary classification problem. The task is to classify if a given product review is positive or negative. Used recurrent neural network based approach (RNN, such as Bidirectional LSTM Architecture Model). The data set used in this competition relates to beauty product reviews from Amazon

## A3: Image Data. Binary Classification
Predict if the chest x-ray image is covid-19 positive or negative. The images are collected from different sources, were taken in different machines, and come with different resolutions (So some pre-processing techniques are necessary to be implemented).
